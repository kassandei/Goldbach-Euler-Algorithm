# Goldbach-Euler Algorithm

This C++ program implements the Goldbach-Euler algorithm to find pairs of prime numbers that sum up to even numbers within a specified range.

## Introduction
The Goldbach-Euler algorithm is an extension of the Goldbach conjecture, which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. The Goldbach-Euler algorithm aims to find these pairs of prime numbers within a given range.

## Usage
To use this program, follow the instructions provided below.

## Compilation
You can compile the program using a C++ compiler such as `g++`. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ goldbach_euler.cpp -o goldbach_euler
